  I am currently working at the CRC 1342 "Global Dynamics of Social Policy" at the University of Bremen, where my main task is to collect data on unemployment protection schemes globally.
  
  Data collection is one of my 'passionS'.
  During my time as student assistant I already co-created the Global Work Injury Policy Database (GWIP) with Nate Breznau.
  
  I also created a dataset on LGBTQI+ rights with my fellow PhD Colleague Mara Junge. For a full list of my data sets check here. 
  
  I am also excited about learning to code. If you wanna have a look at my current projects, check out my blog!
