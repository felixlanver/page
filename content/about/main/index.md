  I'm a PhD Researcher at the CRC 1342 "Global Dynamics of Social Policy" at the University of Bremen, where I conduct research on the global development of unemployment protection schemes with a regional focus on Latin America.
  
  My academic research is based on data collection and analysis.
  
  My current project is the creation of a data set on the global development of unemployment protection schemes.
  
  I also build a data set on LGBTQI+ rights with my fellow PhD researcher Mara Junge. 
  
  As a student assistant I co-created the Global Work Injury Policy Database ([GWIP](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IVKYIE)) with Nate Breznau.
  
  I hold a Master's degree in Global Politics and Society from the University of Milan and a Bachelor's degree in Integrated European Studies and a Master's degree in European Labour Studies and Social Policy from the University of Bremen.
