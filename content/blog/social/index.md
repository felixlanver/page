excerpt: This is my first blog entry where I describe my experience with creating my own website using RStudio, blogdown, Hugo and Netlify.
  A big thanks goes to Alison Hill who not only created the Hugo Apero scheme but also made a bunch of tutorials on all kinds of platforms. 
  I will link to a couple of them at the bottom.

As I finished my studies this year and started my first real job as doctoral researcher at the University of Bremen I thought it was about time to (nice metaphor) and create my own professional website.
Of course I did not just want to fill out a few forms on a boring template. Instead I took it as an opportunity to double down on my latest (passion): Coding.
So as I said down to ... my colleage Heiner(link) mentioned the possibility of going full nerd and just do it in R. 

So that's what I did.

- Netlify

That was easy!
