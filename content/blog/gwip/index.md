## Title
The Global Work-Injury Policy Database (GWIP) provides data on the introduction and development of work-injury policy in 186 independent nation states. Work-injury policies were historically known as “workmen’s compensation”, "workman's compensation" and sometimes “accident insurance” among policymakers and scholars. The data include year of introduction of first laws, the types of laws, coverage of blue-collar workers and steps on the path to social insurance laws. (2020-09-08)
